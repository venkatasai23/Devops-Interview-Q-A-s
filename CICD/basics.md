# ðŸš€ CI/CD â€“ Basics

---

## 1. What is CI/CD and why is it important?

**Continuous Integration (CI)** automates merging code changes into a shared repo, with builds & tests each commit.  

**Continuous Delivery (CD)** automatically deploys successful builds to staging/production.  
Benefits: faster feedback, reduced integration pain, higher deployment frequency.

## 2. CI vs CD vs Continuous Deployment

- **CD (Delivery)**: Manual approval before production.  

- **Continuous Deployment**: Fully automated deploy on success.
